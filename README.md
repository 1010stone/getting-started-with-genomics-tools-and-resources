### Genomics-visualization-tools

There are many online web based tools for visualization of (cancer) genomic data. I put my collections here.

* [UCSC cancer genome browser](https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/proj/site/hgHeatmap/) It has many data including TCGA data buit in, and can be very handy for both bench scientist and bioinformaticians.  
* [UCSC Xena](http://xena.ucsc.edu/). A new tool developed by UCSC team as well. Poteintially very useful, but need more tutorials to follow.
* [UCSC genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/). One of the most famous genome browser and my favoriate. **Every person** studying genetics, genomics and molecular biology needs to know how to use it. [Tutorials from OpenHelix](http://blog.openhelix.eu/?p=22649).

### Databases
* [DisGeNET](http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/home?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) is a discovery platform integrating information on gene-disease associations (GDAs) from several public data sources and the literature
* [Cancer3D](http://cancer3d.org/) is a database that unites information on somatic missense mutations from TCGA and CCLE, allowing users to explore two different cancer-related problems at the same time: drug sensitivity/biomarker identification and prediction of cancer drivers
* [clinical intepretations of variants in cancer](https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/home)
* [BioGrid](http://thebiogrid.org/) Welcome to the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets

### Large data consortium data mining

* [AnnotationHub](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHub/inst/doc/AnnotationHub-HOWTO.html#roadmap-epigenomics-project) bioconductor package for TCGA and epigenome roadmap, ENCODE project.  
* [TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/tcgaBiolinks.html) bioconductor package
* [RTCGA bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/RTCGA.html)

### Tutorials
* [PH525x series - Biomedical Data Science](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/). Learn R and bioconductor.
* [PCA, MDS, k-means, Hierarchical clustering and heatmap](https://rpubs.com/crazyhottommy/PCA_MDS). I wrote it.
* [Survival analysis of TCGA patients integrating gene expression (RNASeq) data](https://www.biostars.org/p/153013/)
* [Tutorial: Machine Learning For Cancer Classification](https://www.biostars.org/p/85124/). It has four parts. 
* [Learning bash scripting for beginners](http://www.cyberciti.biz/open-source/learning-bash-scripting-for-beginners/)  
* [Bedtools tutorial](http://quinlanlab.org/tutorials/cshl2013/bedtools.html)  
* [Gemini](http://gemini.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#tutorials) explores your vcf, and [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/arq5x).
* [GNU parallel](https://www.biostars.org/p/63816/)
