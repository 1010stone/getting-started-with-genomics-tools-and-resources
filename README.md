### Genomics-visualization-tools

There are many online web based tools for visualization of (cancer) genomic data. I put my collections here.

* [UCSC cancer genome browser](https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/proj/site/hgHeatmap/) It has many data including TCGA data buit in, and can be very handy for both bench scientist and bioinformaticians.  
* [UCSC Xena](http://xena.ucsc.edu/). A new tool developed by UCSC team as well. Poteintially very useful, but need more tutorials to follow.
* [UCSC genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/). One of the most famous genome browser and my favoriate. **Every person** studying genetics, genomics and molecular biology needs to know how to use it. [Tutorials from OpenHelix](http://blog.openhelix.eu/?p=22649).
